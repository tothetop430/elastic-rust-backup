# elasticsearch-rs type codegen
Yet another work in progress Elasticsearch client for Rust.

A library for compiler plugins and macros used by the `elastic_types` crate. The focus for this crate is to make it easy to do as much work at comile-time as possible. This includes converting Elasticsearch [date foramts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/mapping-date-format.html) to a tree of `Item`s.
