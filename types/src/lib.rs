//! Elasticsearch Core Types
//!
//! A high-level implementation of the core types in Elasticsearch documents.
//! 
//! Types within this crate are self-contained and handle their own serialisation/deserialisation requirements.
//! Each type also supplies a `struct` for its [Put Mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html) properties.
